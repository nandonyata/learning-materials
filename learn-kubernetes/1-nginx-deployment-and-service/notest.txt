Each config file has 3 parts:
1. Metadata
2. Specification
3. Status => automatically generated and added by kubernetes


What is MiniKube
=> One node cluster, where Master and Worker Node processes both runs in once machine/node.
And this node will have a dokcer container runtime pre-installed.
=> Minikube is a tool that allows you to run Kubernetes locally. 
It sets up a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, which is perfect for learning, development, and testing purposes.


What is KubeCtl
=> A command line tools for kubernetes cluster.
=>
So one of the master processes called API Server, its actually the main entrypoint on the kubernetes cluster.
So if you wanted to do anything in kubernetes, configure, create any component, we first talk to the API Server.
And the way to talk to the API Server is through different clients:
- UI like dashboard
- API like kubernetes API
- CLI like KubeCtl => most powerfull of all the 3 clients


MiniKube & kubectl COMMANDs:
1. minikube start --driver=docker
2. minikube status
3. kubectl get node => get status of nodes
