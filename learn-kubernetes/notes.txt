If we are going to do k8s on production, better use AWS kubernetes engine.
Because its easier to use and maintain.
Unless we are expert in it, even chatgpt said "If you're not afraid of breaking things ðŸ˜…" lol.

Self-managed:
- Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 â€“ install and manage K8s yourself [NOT RECCOMMENDED, BUT GOOD TO TRY AND LEARN ONLY]

Engines:
- EKS
- ECS (Elastic Container Service) - AWS's own container orchestration (not Kubernetes-based).

Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS are both container orchestration services on AWS, but they differ significantly in architecture, 
flexibility, complexity, and ecosystem.
Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown:

| Feature                          | **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** | **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Orchestration Engine**         | AWS-native                                 | Kubernetes (open-source standard)            |
| **Learning Curve**               | Easier to get started                      | Steeper (Kubernetes complexity)              |
| **Flexibility & Portability**    | Less portable (AWS-optimized)              | Very portable (works on any K8s environment) |
| **Community & Ecosystem**        | Smaller, AWS-only                          | Large, open-source community                 |
| **Vendor Lock-in**               | High (AWS proprietary APIs)                | Low (uses Kubernetes APIs)                   |
| **Control Plane Management**     | Fully managed                              | Managed, but more involved                   |
| **Custom Resources/Operators**   | Limited                                    | Fully supported                              |
| **Deployment Options**           | AWS only                                   | AWS, on-prem, hybrid (via EKS Anywhere)      |
| **Autoscaling & Load Balancing** | Native support                             | Via Kubernetes tools or AWS integration      |
| **Fargate Support**              | Yes                                        | Yes                                          |
| **Use Case**                     | Simpler AWS-only containerized workloads   | Complex, cross-cloud                         |


Use ECS if you:
- Want the simplest way to run containers on AWS.
- Don't need to manage Kubernetes complexity.
- Are fine being tightly coupled to AWS.
- Want tight integration with AWS features like IAM, CloudWatch, etc.

Use EKS if you:
- Need Kubernetes features (CRDs, Helm, service mesh, etc.).
- Want to standardize on Kubernetes across multiple clouds or environments.
- Already have Kubernetes expertise or existing workloads.
- Need vendor-neutral infrastructure.

TL;DR:
- ECS is simpler, AWS-native, less flexible.
- EKS is Kubernetes-based, portable, more powerful but complex.



| Approach                    | Pros                                                                | Cons                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual (bare metal)**     | Full control, great for learning, no vendor lock-in                 | Complex, error-prone, harder to scale, more maintenance |
| **Managed (EKS, GKE, AKS)** | Easier to set up, autoscaling, built-in HA, upgrades, logging, etc. | Slightly higher cost, less low-level control            |


TL;DR:
Manual setup is great for learning, but for production most companies use managed services (like EKS) to reduce complexity.

So if you're finding it hard â€” thatâ€™s totally normal. Most people do. You're doing great just getting this far.
