Basically this is just the same as "2-docker-compose", 
but here we also add one more service that is our own GOLANG image

 - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
 - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=psw

 We can replace the hardcoded value for db username & passw by putting environment var ${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME}, then in terminal
 execute this before starting building the app
 export MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
 export MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=psw

 or for better approach, search about docker compose secret
